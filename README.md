## Overview

The app uses mDNS to automatically discover other libp2p peers on the same Local Area Network (LAN). Once discovered, you can begin a message thread with them similar to the Messages app.

## Why?

It's an example of how you can integrate swift-libp2p into an iOS App! ü•≥ 

The entire app, UI and LibP2P stack (mDNS, TCP, MPLEX, Noise), consumes less than 40MB of ram! üçÉ 

## Try it out

Check it out by...

1) Cloning this repo.

2) Open the project in Xcode.

3) Change the Team / Bundle Identifier under Signing and Capabilities to your Team and Bundle Identifier.

4) Select an iOS Simulator to run the app on. 

5) Build and Run the Project.

6) Run the app on two devices connected to the same LAN and they should discover one another within a few seconds and a chat dialog will become available!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed! This code is very much a proof of concept. I can guarantee you there's a better / safer way to accomplish the same results. Any suggestions, improvements, or even just critques, are welcome! 

Let's make this code better together! ü§ù
